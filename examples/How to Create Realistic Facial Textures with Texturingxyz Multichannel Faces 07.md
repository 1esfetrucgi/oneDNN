In this article, we will show you how to use one of the multichannel face textures from Texturing.xyz, the Female 30s Multichannel Face #07[^2^], to create a realistic female character in ZBrush. This texture pack includes a full-face albedo map, a nose albedo map, a multichannel face displacement map, a multichannel nose displacement map, and utility maps for specular, glossiness, and translucency. The resolution of the full-face maps is 8081 x 5089 px, and the resolution of the nose maps is 1737 x 1521 px. The file format is tif.
 
## Step 1: Import the Texture Maps
 
The first step is to import the texture maps into ZBrush. You can do this by going to Texture > Import and selecting the files from your computer. You will see the texture maps appear in the Texture palette. You can also drag and drop the files into ZBrush.
 
## Step 2: Apply the Albedo Map
 
The next step is to apply the albedo map to your 3D model. You can do this by selecting the full-face albedo map from the Texture palette and clicking on FillObject in the Color menu. This will fill your model with the color information from the texture map. You can also use Spotlight to project the texture onto your model.
 
## Step 3: Apply the Displacement Map
 
The next step is to apply the displacement map to your model. You can do this by selecting the multichannel face displacement map from the Texture palette and clicking on Apply DispMap in the Tool > Displacement Map menu. This will apply the displacement information from the texture map to your model. You can adjust the intensity of the displacement by changing the Intensity slider in the same menu.
 
## Step 4: Refine the Details
 
The final step is to refine the details of your model using the nose albedo map, the nose displacement map, and the utility maps. You can use these maps to add more realism and variation to your model's skin. For example, you can use the nose albedo map to paint more details on your model's nose using Spotlight or polypaint. You can use the nose displacement map to add more depth and shape to your model's nose using Apply DispMap or sculpting brushes. You can use the utility maps to control how your model's skin reacts to light using different material channels such as specular, glossiness, and translucency.
