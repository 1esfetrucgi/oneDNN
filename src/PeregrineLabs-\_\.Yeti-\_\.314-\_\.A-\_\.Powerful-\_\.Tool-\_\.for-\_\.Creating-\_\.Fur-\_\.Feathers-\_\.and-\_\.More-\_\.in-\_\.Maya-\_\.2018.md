# PeregrineLabs Yeti 3.1.4: A Powerful Tool for Creating Fur, Feathers and More in Maya 2018
 
PeregrineLabs Yeti 3.1.4 is a plugin for Autodesk Maya 2018 that allows users to create realistic fur, feathers and other complex hair-like structures using a procedural node graph. Yeti is designed to be package agnostic and supports various rendering engines, including Pixar's Renderman, 3Delight, Chaos Group's Vray, Solid Angle's Arnold, Redshift, and Clarisse.

Yeti 3.1.4 is the latest version of the plugin that introduces several improvements and bug fixes. Some of the new features include:
 
- A new **Feather** node that simplifies the creation of feather structures with customizable parameters.
- A new **Scatter** node that allows users to distribute fibers or geometry along a surface with randomization options.
- A new **Cache** node that enables users to cache the output of any node for faster playback and rendering.
- A new **Curve Width** attribute that controls the width of the fibers along the curve length.
- A new **Curve Resample** attribute that adjusts the number of segments in the curve for better performance and quality.
- A new **Curve Bend** attribute that adds curvature to the fibers for more natural results.
- A new **Fiber Width Ramp** attribute that allows users to vary the width of the fibers along their length using a ramp.
- A new **Fiber Color Ramp** attribute that allows users to vary the color of the fibers along their length using a ramp.
- A new **Fiber Twist Ramp** attribute that allows users to vary the twist of the fibers along their length using a ramp.
- A new **Fiber Bend Ramp** attribute that allows users to vary the bend of the fibers along their length using a ramp.
- A new **Fiber Clump Ramp** attribute that allows users to vary the clumping of the fibers along their length using a ramp.
- A new **Fiber Frizz Ramp** attribute that allows users to vary the frizz of the fibers along their length using a ramp.
- A new **Fiber Kink Ramp** attribute that allows users to vary the kink of the fibers along their length using a ramp.
- A new **Fiber Curl Ramp** attribute that allows users to vary the curl of the fibers along their length using a ramp.
- A new **Fiber Cut Ramp** attribute that allows users to vary the cut of the fibers along their length using a ramp.
- A new **Fiber Density Ramp** attribute that allows users to vary the density of the fibers along their length using a ramp.
- A new **Fiber Length Ramp** attribute that allows users to vary the length of the fibers along their length using a ramp.
- A new **Fiber Segment Ramp** attribute that allows users to vary the segment count of the fibers along their length using a ramp.
- A new **Fiber Width Scale** attribute that scales the width of all fibers uniformly.
- A new **Fiber Color Scale** attribute that scales the color of all fibers uniformly.
- A new **Fiber Twist Scale** attribute that scales the twist of all fibers uniformly.
- A new **Fiber Bend Scale** attribute that scales the bend of all fibers uniformly.
- A new **Fiber Clump Scale** attribute that scales the clumping of all fibers uniformly.
- A new **Fiber Frizz Scale** attribute that scales 0f148eb4a0
